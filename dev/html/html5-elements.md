HTML5 elements
==============

Excellent flowchart: http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png

section
-------

Group together thematically-related content

Ask yourself - "Is all this content related?"

Eg: Layout split into 'intro' section, 'news' section, 'contact' section

article
-------

Ask yourself - "Could this content belong as an entry within an RSS feed?"

Eg: Blog post, comment, etc

header
------

Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids and usually contains the section's heading

Most sections and articles have one

footer
------

Contains information about its parent element, eg: who wrote it, copyright, links to  related content, etc

NOT a description of the position

aside
-----

Holds related content

Ask yourself - "Can this be removed without reducing the meaning of the main content?"

Just because the content appears on the left or right of the main content does not make it an aside

Eg: within an article; related links, pull quotes, glossaries
Eg: outside an article; sidebars, blog roll, advertising

nav
---

Intended for major navigation information

A group of links grouped together isnâ€™t enough reason to use the nav element
